## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the xtUML Model Compiler for Python! This document provides an overview of the fundamental principles and concepts that shape the design and organization of our system. A deep understanding of these concepts will assist developers, contributors, and users in effectively engaging with the application.

### Logical Organization

At the logical level, the xtUML JSON to Python Translator organizes information and functions into a conceptual structure, adhering to the principle of having one table/class per Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) object.

### Data Organization - Centralized

All data used by the application is stored and managed in a centralized manner, facilitating efficient access and data management.

### Physical Organization - Direct Correspondence

The physical structure of the application directly mirrors its logical structure, establishing a direct correspondence between logical elements and their physical representation in the system.

### Memory Management - Operating System

The application relies on the memory management provided by the operating system to ensure efficient use of memory resources.

### Instance Relationship - Relational or Object Oriented Approach

In managing relationships between instances or objects, the application offers the flexibility to choose between a relational-oriented approach and an object-oriented approach, based on development needs.

### Relationship Integrity - Require All Unconditional

Integrity of relationships is maintained by ensuring that all relationships in the system meet unconditional requirements without exceptions.

### Referential Attributes - Store as Part of Physical 50/50 + Look Up Across

Referential attributes are stored partly as physical attributes and partly through lookup across data structures, creating a balanced approach.

### Derived Attributes - Derived for Each Access

Derived attributes are calculated each time they are accessed, ensuring the accuracy of derived values without burdening physical storage.
